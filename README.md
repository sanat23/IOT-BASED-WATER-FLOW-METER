## IOT BASED WATER FLOW METER
Developed a smart IoT-based water flow meter system to monitor and manage water usage efficiently. The project involved using water flow sensors connected to a NodeMCU board to measure water flow rates and volumes in real-time. Data was transmitted to a cloud platform via the MQTT protocol for analysis and monitoring. The system featured an OLED display for local data visualization and was designed to be cost-effective, easy to install, and low-maintenance, offering potential applications in residential, agricultural, and industrial water management systems. The project demonstrated the ability to detect leaks and reduce water wastage by providing real-time insights into water usage.
